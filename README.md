# Autism-Spectrum-Disorder-in-Adults

This is a personal-project I worked on.

# Motivation

Over the next decade, an estimated 707,000 to 1,116,000 teens (70,700 to 111,600 each year) will enter adulthood and age out of school based autism services [Source:https://www.autismspeaks.org/autism-statistics]
The life of adults with autism is not easy and seeking diagnosis could be challenging for them as
(1) Firstly, people who did not receive a diagnosis in their younger years may have milder symptoms, which can be more difficult for a doctor to recognize
(2) Secondly, if people have been living with ASD for some time, they may be better at disguising or managing the signs and symptoms.
So, individuals may wish to begin with a self-assessment test for adults. While these tests cannot confirm a diagnosis, they are a good starting point and provide material to discuss with a healthcare professional.[Source:https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/326841#diagnosis]

Our problem precisely focuses on just that. Having a screening test would help individuals decide if they would want to be diagnosed and for healthcare professionals, it would reduce the cases attended and the costs involved.

# Data
This data set has been sourced from the Machine Learning Repository of University of California, Irvine Autism Screening Adult Data Set (UC Irvine). 
The UCI page mentions the following as the original source of the data set:

Fadi Fayez Thabtah, Department of Digital Technology, Manukau Institute of Technology, Auckland, New Zealand 

# Approach

1.Data Pre-processing and EDA
2.Split the set into predictor set and label

3.Split the set into train and test set
4.Filling missing values, Class imbalance - upsampling and Feature Selection
5.Modeling
6.Observations

# Observations

The results of the models seem to line with our EDA as well.
1.The answers to the behavioural questions seems to have a strong effect on the probability of someone having ASD.
2.Bias based on results of the individual information in the model-check on that
3.Response bias of respondents to be kept in mind
